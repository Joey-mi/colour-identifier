# Colour Scrapper 
## To see more please travel to the 'colour-pyscript' branch or 'the-interface' branch
## Description
This project will scrape all colours in a webpage and display it for the user as a chrome extension. Still a WIP right now and while buggy only the code in the 'colour-pyscript' branch can be used at the moment. 

The UI or chrome extension is being developed in the 'the-interface' branch as a react project while the python script is located in the 'colour-pyscript' branch but will include a javascript version in the future so it can be used in a chrome extension.

## Setup
As the script isn't connected to the chrome extension project in 'the-interface' branch the setup instructions will be found in the 'colour-pyscript' branch.

##Limitations
- Only supports google chrome
- Only tested on a windows OS
- Need to have a google chrome tab open before running the project
